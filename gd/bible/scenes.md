## NPC scenes
NPC scenes are always available giving the player has at least the minimum
score needed for that particular character.

A simple first introduction scene is available in the beginning and the single
point given by this scene unlocks the new ones. This forces the player to have
always this first scene with each character.

Consider that the afternoon activities give 3 points to the related NPC.

An special scene to divulge the existence of the "informant" is available in
the third tier of affinity with each character, giving multiple opportunities
for the informant to warn the character about talking with anyone about him.

Finally, the ending scene for each NPC is triggered only on the last night.
