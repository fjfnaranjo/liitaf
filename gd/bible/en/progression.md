## Story arcs
### Main arc
The main arc or PP is the arc of the player character. He is called Maverick by
default and he is a brave and idealistic soldier in the air forces. He wants to
contribute to society advancement but he found that the military corruption is
holding the army back and he wants to change it. To do it, he has to go back to
the academy and study to ascend in ranks to a Five Star General.
### Platypus conspiracy
The Platypus Empire is infiltrating the human society after the discovery of
the advancements in space travel technology. A group of platypus spies is
taking over the appearance of young military students at the military academies
all over the world. They may get romantically involved with the player and develop
feelings for him. This is the CP.
### Romantic arcs
Each NPCs has their own arc corresponding to each of the NPC plots. In the end,
all of them can get emotionally involved with the player, even if they conspire
to make him stop ascending in the ranks.
## Full game structure
The game is broken into five days. There are 3 sections in each day.

The academy section is were the NPC scenes are shown to the player. This
section is subsequently divided in three class periods with passing periods in
between, a pre-class period and an after-class period. The passings, pre-class
and after-class are the periods (4 in total) when the player can pick a single
location/character and topic to interact.

After school, there is an extra curricular activity section. The first day,
only the "Study" activity is present and the player has to do it. The next
four days, the player can do activities proposed by the NPCs to increase their
score even more, but "Study" will be always available as a fallback.

The third section represents a TV broadcast watched by the player and a series
of calls by an old friend revealing information about the platypus conspiracy.
This calls will be interrupted by the NPCs if the player ever tells them about
his friend without a sufficient development in their plots. If the calls are
interrupted, the player just studies.

The last night is the game resolution night and the "night date" scenes for
each character are shown in other of affinity (then, order of character in the
top list) to allow the player to pick one and only one. This scene replaces the
normal TV/informant scene.

After this last scene, the summary scene is shown and the game ends.
## Keypoints
- The protagonist plot is hinted in the beginning and the romantic partners are
  distractions from it. This is also softly hinted.
- The protagonist may get involved with the platypuses without knowledge of the
  conspiracy and he will remain oblivious to the fact in the end, hinting the
  player with suspicious remarks. This will block the game good ending.
- If he gets sufficiently involved with them, he can stop their involvement in
  the conspiracy if he knows about it. But the platypuses will succeed
  eventually if the player doesn't become a Five Star General.
- The protagonist can ignore the platypuses completely.
## Score sources
### PP
- Each class period adds 1 point (4x5=20).
- Each "Study" extracurricular adds 2 point (first point is mandatory).
- Two NPC scenes per NPC can optionally add 1 point.
### CP
- Each of the 4 night scenes with the informant add 1 point.
- One NPC scene per NPC can optionally add 1 point.
### NP
- Each NPC scene can add between 1 and 3 points. Some dialogue options will
  enforce a 1.
- Each extracurricular will add 2 points.
## Game endings (work is pending from here)
### Ending award criteria and order
The game awards the endings in two different sections.

The first section is the PP section and shows if the player succeeds in his
main objective.

| PP score | CP score | Award |
| -------- | -------- | ----- |
|   <=23   |   <=4    |       |
|   <=23   |    >4    |       |
| >23,<=26 |   <=4    |       |
| >23,<=26 |    >4    |       |
|    >26   |   <=4    |       |
|    >26   |    >4    |       |

The second section is the NP section and shows how the NPCs affected the
player and what happened to them in the future.
### Main story endings
#### Bad ending
If the PP score is low, the player fails to upgrade his rank and is discharged
from the academy. He will continue working as a soldier in the shadow of the
corrupt power. Humanity is doomed to the platypus invasion.

The player doesn't know about the platypuses: the "missing ending" for each NPC
is shown to the player.

or choose to stay with a platypus
knowingly: The player will be rewarded with the NPC character "dark ending" if
the score with the NPC is low. On a higher score, the "converse ending" will be
rewarded instead.

The player knows about the platypuses or avoid to stay with a platypus: The
"executed ending" will be rewarded instead.
