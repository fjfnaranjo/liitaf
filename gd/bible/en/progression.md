## Story arcs
### Main arc
The main arc or PP is the arc of the player character. He is called Maverick by
default and he is a brave and idealistic soldier in the air forces. He wants to
contribute to society advancement but he found that the military corruption is
holding the army back and he wants to change it. To do it, he has to go back to
the academy and study to ascend in ranks to a Five Star General.
### Platypus conspiracy
The Platypus Empire is infiltrating the human society after the discovery of
the advancements in space travel technology. A group of platypus spies is
taking over the appearance of young military students at the military academies
all over the world. They may get romantically involved with the player and develop
feelings for him. This is the CP.
### Romantic arcs
Each NPCs has their own arc corresponding to each of the NPC plots. In the end,
all of them can get emotionally involved with the player, even if they conspire
to make him stop ascending in the ranks.
## Full game structure
The game is broken into four days. There are 3 sections in each day.

The academy section is were the NPC scenes are available to the player. This
section is subsequently divided in three class periods with passing periods in
between, a pre-class period and an after-class period. The passings, pre-class
and after-class are the periods (4 in total) when the player can pick a single
location/character and topic to interact. The player can also study instead of
interact with the NPCs in this periods.

After school, there is an extra curricular activity section. The first day,
only the "Study" activity is present and the player has to do it. The next
four days, the player can do activities proposed by the NPCs to increase their
score even more, but "Study" will be always available as a fallback.

The third section represents a TV broadcast watched by the player and a series
of calls by an old friend revealing information about the platypus conspiracy.
This calls will be interrupted by the NPCs if the player ever tells them about
his friend without a sufficient development in their plots. If the calls are
interrupted, the player just studies.

In the forth day, the game ends in the extracurriculars section. The end scene
replaces this section.
## Keypoints
- The protagonist plot is hinted in the beginning and the romantic partners are
  distractions from it. This is also softly hinted.
- The protagonist may get involved with the platypuses without knowledge of the
  conspiracy and he will remain oblivious to the fact in the end, hinting the
  player with suspicious remarks. This will block the game good ending.
- If he gets sufficiently involved with them, he can stop their involvement in
  the conspiracy if he knows about it. But the platypuses will succeed
  eventually if the player doesn't become a Five Star General.
- The protagonist can ignore the platypuses completely.
## Game scores and endings
### Academy scene scores
Studying in the academy pass periods awards 1 PP point.

Each scene with a NPC awards 0-1 point or, exceptionally, 2 points. 0 is rare,
some scenes didn't even have that option. 2 is even more rare, only 1 or 2
scenes per NPC have this option.

CP scores are available in NPC scenes at the academy and the maximum amount
will depend on the NP tier (available CP = Tier - 2 (min. 0)).

In the days 2 and 3, in some of the passing periods, NPCs are distributed in
variant groups and the player can get 1 NP in one of the NPCs in the group. A
total of 1 CP can be scored in this scenes. Individual conversation are
unavailable in this periods (the NPC can't be in two places at the same time).
### Extracurricular scene scores
Taking the "Study" awards 2 points and is always available.

The first day, an special "party" scene is an alternative to "Study" and always
awards 2 NPs (to 1 or 2 NPCs) and up to 1 CP.

From day 2, if the NPCs had level II scenes with the player, an
extracurriculars with the NPCs is available as an alternative to "Study" and
